By default, custom post types and custom fields are not accessible via the WordPress REST API. REST API Enabler allows you to:

1. Choose which custom post types to enable, and specify their REST API endpoint.
2. Choose which custom fields to include in API responses for posts, pages, and custom post types.

The plugin is compatible with v2+ of the WordPress Rest API.
